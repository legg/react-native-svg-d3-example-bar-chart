# Example use of react-native-svg and d3 working on react-native ios/android 

Recreated the d3js [Bar Chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304) using react-native-svg and d3js.

d3js has lots of dom helpers which rely on the dom document so it is difficult to take the bl.ocks.org examples for react-native.

Thanks to [Wolff](http://hswolff.com/blog/react-native-art-and-d3/) I managed to get it working.
